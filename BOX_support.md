Welcome to BOX!  
If the program is not working, BOX does not work in Windows 7 and below.  
If your system is Windows 8.1 or higher, you may need to install Python 3.12.1 from the website or MS Store and auto-py-to-exe with PowerShell(My recommendation) using the following command "pip install auto-py-to-exe".
